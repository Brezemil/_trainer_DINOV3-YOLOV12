# FiftyOne VLM Efficient#

A comprehensive toolkit for improving Vision-Language Model (VLM) training data quality through state-of-the-art research techniques in FiftyOne

## Project Vision#

In the rapidly evolving field of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), data quality has emerged as a critical factor in model performance. This project aims to make advanced data quality improvement techniques accessible to anyone working with VLMs, integrating proven methods from top research labs like NVIDIAâs VILA, LLaVA and more.

Our goal is to make state-of-the-art data quality techniques accessible to everyone - from individual developers and hobbyists to large companies. We provide easy-to-use plugins that help improve training data efficiency and quality for vision-language models, without requiring deep expertise in the field.

## Key Features#

### 1\. Dataset Pruning#

  * **SIEVE Method** \- State-of-the-art multimodal dataset pruning using image captioning models

    * Generates multiple captions for semantic similarity comparison

    * Fuses with CLIP scores for improved results

    * Efficient dataset filtering based on quality metrics

## Usage Examples#

This example demonstrates how to load and process the LAION GPT4Vision captions dataset:
    
    
    import fiftyone as fo
    import fiftyone.zoo as foz
    from fiftyone.utils.huggingface import load_from_hub
    
    # Load the dataset from the Hugging Face Hub
    dataset = load_from_hub(
        "laion/220k-GPT4Vision-captions-from-LIVIS",
        format="parquet",
        filepath="url",
        max_samples=10, 
    )
    
    # Launch the FiftyOne app for visualization
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
    
    # Keep the app running until manually closed
    session.wait()
    

The LAION dataset contains high-quality GPT4Vision-generated captions that can be used to:

  * Train and evaluate VLM models

  * Benchmark caption quality

  * Generate reference captions for quality assessment

  * Fine-tune captioning models
