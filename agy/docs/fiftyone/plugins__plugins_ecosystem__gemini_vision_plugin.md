# Gemini Vision Plugin#

![screen-2025-10-15_13 02 13-ezgif com-video-to-webp-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77b4a2f3-8e4b-40dd-921d-3771b257b8d9)

## Plugin Overview#

This plugin integrates Google Geminiâs multimodal Vision models (including the latest `gemini-3-pro-preview`) into your FiftyOne workflows. Prompt with text and one or more images; receive a text response grounded in visual inputs. Now featuring Gemini 3.0 with advanced reasoning capabilities!

# Installation#

If you havenât already, install FiftyOne:
    
    
    pip install fiftyone
    

Then, install the plugin:
    
    
    fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/AdonaiVera/gemini-vision-plugin
    

To use Gemini Vision, set the following environment variable with your API key:

  * `GEMINI_API_KEY`




**Getting your API Key:** Follow this step-by-step guide to create your Gemini API key: [Getting Your API Key Guide](https://github.com/google-gemini/nano-banana-hackathon-kit/blob/main/guides/01-getting-your-api-key.ipynb)

**Important:** You need an active Google Cloud account with billing enabled and credits to use the Gemini API. The free tier has limited quotas. If you encounter quota errors like âQuota exceeded for metric: generativelanguage.googleapis.com/generate_content_free_tier_requestsâ, youâll need to:

  1. Enable billing on your Google Cloud project

  2. Purchase credits or upgrade to a paid plan

  3. Monitor your usage at: https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit




Refer to the official docs for pricing and quotas: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits

## Getting your Data into FiftyOne#

To use GPT-4 Vision, you will need to have a dataset of images in FiftyOne. If you donât have a dataset, you can create one from a directory of images:
    
    
    import fiftyone as fo
    
    # Load BDD unsafe/safe dataset 
    dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(
        "https://github.com/AdonaiVera/bddoia-fiftyone",
        split="validation",
        max_samples=10
    )
    dataset.persistent = True
    
    ## view the dataset in the App
    session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
    

# Operators#

## `query_gemini_vision`#

Multi-task vision operator with three modes:

### Chat#

![question_answer_gemini-ezgif com-optiwebp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48dce8da-fcca-443a-8398-a51020d4b125)

Ask questions about your images. Supports up to 64K output tokens with Gemini 3.0.

### OCR#

![ocr_gemini](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1b3eb6a-6d08-415f-91e1-6ab1dc6b6f0f)

Extract text with bounding boxes. Results stored as `fo.Detections`.

### Spatial#

![pointing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a5bf159-2e90-433e-a13d-cac5bab796d2)

Detect points/keypoints (e.g., pose estimation, object pointing). Results stored as `fo.Keypoints`.

**Inputs:**

  * `task`: Select mode (`chat`, `ocr`, `spatial`)

  * `model`: Gemini model (default: `gemini-3-pro-preview`)

  * `query_text`: Prompt for chat/spatial tasks

  * `label_field`: Field name to store OCR/spatial results




## `text_to_image`#

![text_image-ezgif com-video-to-webp-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb1ce21-3cfd-4649-ba5e-24e2a035c7c4)

Generate high-quality images from text descriptions using Geminiâs image generation capabilities.

Inputs:

  * `prompt`: Text description of the image to generate

  * `model`: Choose between `gemini-2.5-flash-image` or `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (Nano Banana Pro - default, supports 2K/4K)

  * `aspect_ratio`: Choose from multiple aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, etc.)




The generated image is automatically saved to your dataset with metadata including the prompt and generation type.

## `image_editing`#

![edit_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0b6a483-fe22-464f-98f2-4d27b5cf21eb)

Edit existing images using text instructions. Provide an image and use text prompts to add, remove, or modify elements, change the style, or adjust the color grading.

Inputs:

  * `prompt`: Edit instruction (e.g., âadd sunglassesâ, âchange to watercolor styleâ)

  * `model`: **NEW** \- Choose between `gemini-2.5-flash-image` or `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (Nano Banana Pro - default)

  * `aspect_ratio`: Choose from multiple aspect ratios




Select exactly one image from your dataset. The edited image is automatically saved to your dataset with the original prompt preserved.

## `multi_image_composition`#

Compose a new image from multiple input images. Use multiple images to create a new scene or transfer the style from one image to another.

Inputs:

  * `prompt`: Composition instruction (e.g., âcombine these in a collageâ, âtransfer style from first to secondâ)

  * `model`: **NEW** \- Choose between `gemini-2.5-flash-image` or `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (Nano Banana Pro - default)

  * `aspect_ratio`: Choose from multiple aspect ratios




Select 2-3 images from your dataset (optimally up to 3 images). The composed image is automatically saved to your dataset.

## `video_understanding`#

![video_describing-ezgif com-video-to-webp-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/559420bd-2b08-4941-a2db-12d373eff178)

Analyze and extract information from videos using Geminiâs video understanding capabilities.

Inputs:

  * `task_type`: Choose analysis type (describe, segment, extract, question)

  * `prompt`: Analysis prompt describing what you want to know about the video

  * `model`: Select from available Gemini models (default: `gemini-3-pro-preview`)

  * `thinking_level`: **NEW in Gemini 3.0** \- Control reasoning depth (`low` for speed/cost, `high` for complex reasoning)

  * `media_resolution`: **NEW in Gemini 3.0** \- Video frame resolution control:

    * `high` (1,120 tokens/frame) - Recommended for detailed analysis

    * `medium` (560 tokens/frame) - Optimal for PDFs

    * `low` (70 tokens/frame) - Most efficient, fewer tokens consumed




Features:

  * **Describe** : Get a comprehensive description of video content

  * **Segment** : Identify and describe different segments within the video

  * **Extract** : Extract specific information from the video

  * **Question** : Ask specific questions about video content, including timestamp-based queries (e.g., âWhat happens at 0:30?â)




Select exactly one video from your dataset. The video must be under 20MB for inline analysis. Analysis results are automatically saved to the video sampleâs metadata under the `video_analysis` field. Gemini 3.0 consumes fewer tokens per video while providing better reasoning!

Happy exploring!

## Future Enhancements#

Weâre planning to add more exciting features:

  * **Batch Image Generation** : Create multiple images from a single query

  * **Pipeline Support** : Build workflows to generate multiple images with different variations

  * **Dynamic Prompting** : Use dynamic variables per image for automated, customized generation at scale




Stay tuned for updates!
