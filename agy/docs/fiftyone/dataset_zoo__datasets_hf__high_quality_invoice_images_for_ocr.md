## Uses#

### Direct Use#

This dataset is suitable for:

  * **OCR Model Training** : Train text extraction models on structured document layouts

  * **Document Understanding** : Develop models that extract structured information from invoices

  * **Key-Value Extraction** : Train systems to identify and extract specific fields (invoice number, dates, totals, etc.)

  * **Table Detection** : Practice detecting and parsing tabular data in documents

  * **Layout Analysis** : Understand document structure and spatial relationships

  * **Semi-Supervised Learning** : Use annotated samples to label the remaining 6,692 images

  * **Model Evaluation** : Benchmark OCR and document AI models against ground truth annotations




### Out-of-Scope Use#

  * **Real Invoice Processing** : These are synthetic invoices and may not capture all variations in real-world invoice formats

  * **Financial Analysis** : The data is synthetic and does not represent real transactions

  * **Privacy-Sensitive Applications** : While synthetic, the dataset contains realistic addresses and names that should not be assumed to be real




## Dataset Structure#

### FiftyOne Schema#

Each sample in the dataset has the following structure:
    
    
    {
        'id': str,                      # Unique sample ID
        'media_type': 'image',          # Always 'image'
        'filepath': str,                # Absolute path to invoice image
        'tags': [],                     # Empty list (no tags)
        'metadata': {                   # Image metadata
            'size_bytes': int,          # File size in bytes
            'mime_type': 'image/jpeg',  # MIME type
            'width': int,               # Image width in pixels (typically ~1650px)
            'height': int,              # Image height in pixels (typically ~2300px)
            'num_channels': 3,          # RGB channels
        },
        'json_annotation': str | None,  # Structured JSON string (see schema below)
        'ocr_text': str | None,         # Raw OCR text output
    }
    

### JSON Annotation Schema#

For the 1,489 annotated samples, the `json_annotation` field contains a JSON string with the following structure:
    
    
    {
        "invoice": {
            "client_name": "string",
            "client_address": "string (may contain newlines)",
            "seller_name": "string",
            "seller_address": "string (may contain newlines)",
            "invoice_number": "string",
            "invoice_date": "string (MM/DD/YYYY format)",
            "due_date": "string (may be empty)"
        },
        "items": [
            {
                "description": "string (may contain newlines)",
                "quantity": "string (numeric format: X.XX)",
                "total_price": "string (numeric format: XX.XX)"
            }
        ],
        "subtotal": {
            "tax": "string (numeric)",
            "discount": "string (may be empty)",
            "total": "string (numeric)"
        },
        "payment_instructions": {
            "due_date": "string (may be empty)",
            "bank_name": "string (may be empty)",
            "account_number": "string (may be empty)",
            "payment_method": "string (may be empty)"
        }
    }
    

### Data Splits#

The dataset is organized into three batches:

  * **Batch 1** (1,489 images): Fully annotated with JSON metadata and OCR text

  * **Batch 2** (1,491 images): Images only, no annotations

  * **Batch 3** (5,201 images): Images only, no annotations




**Total** : 8,181 invoice images

### Typical Image Characteristics#

  * **Format** : JPEG

  * **Resolution** : ~1650 Ã 2300 pixels (portrait orientation)

  * **File Size** : ~200-250 KB per image

  * **Color** : RGB (3 channels)

  * **Quality** : High-quality synthetic renders with clear text




## Dataset Creation#

### Source Data#

The images are synthetically generated invoices with realistic layouts including:

  * Header with invoice number and date

  * Seller and client information blocks with names, addresses, Tax IDs, and IBAN

  * Itemized table with columns: No., Description, Qty, UM, Net price, Net worth, VAT [%], Gross worth

  * Summary section with VAT breakdown and totals




#### Data Collection and Processing#

This FiftyOne port was created by:

  1. Downloading the original dataset from Kaggle

  2. Parsing CSV annotations for Batch 1 (3 CSV files covering 1,489 images)

  3. Extracting structured JSON and raw OCR text from the CSV

  4. Creating FiftyOne samples with metadata for all 8,181 images

  5. Computing image metadata (dimensions, file size, etc.)




### Annotations#

#### Annotation Process#

The 1,489 annotated samples include:

  * **Structured JSON** : Extracted invoice fields organized hierarchically

  * **Raw OCR Text** : Full text content from the invoice images




The annotations appear to be generated programmatically from the synthetic invoice creation process, ensuring high accuracy between the image content and the ground truth labels.

#### Personal and Sensitive Information#

The dataset contains **synthetic data only**. Names, addresses, Tax IDs, IBANs, and other identifiers are fictionally generated and do not correspond to real individuals or organizations.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations#

### Known Limitations#

  * **Synthetic Data** : Invoices are artificially generated and may not capture the full diversity of real-world invoice formats

  * **Single Language** : All invoices are in English

  * **Uniform Layout** : All invoices follow a similar template structure

  * **Limited Variety** : Invoice items appear to be e-commerce products with simple descriptions

  * **Partial Annotations** : Only 18.2% (1,489/8,181) of images have ground truth annotations




### Recommendations#

  * Use this dataset for **initial model development** and **prototyping**

  * **Augment with real invoice data** for production systems

  * The unannotated images can be labeled using models trained on the annotated subset

  * Consider fine-tuning on domain-specific invoices for production use cases

  * Validate model performance on real invoices before deployment
